# whatnext

Forged by a group of individuals tired of paying for streaming services and not being able to watch what they want to watch, whether due to an unexpectedly shrinking queue or an onslaught of new releases, What’s Next is a single solution to an all-too-common problem. The application pulls from Netflix’s API to provide the user with information pertaining to what films will be streaming soon and what films will be leaving soon. That way, users don’t unexpectedly miss out on content they want to see.

To accomplish this, we utilized the UI Kit CSS framework. Swiper for the carousel. APIs from OMdB and Netflix. Fonts from Google’s API. We also enabled the application to save selections via local storage.
